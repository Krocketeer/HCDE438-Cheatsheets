# Some Useful Libraries

### UI Kits
- Material UI: https://material-ui.com/

- Semantic UI: https://semantic-ui.com/

### General Java Script Utilities
- moment.js (datetime stuff)

### Other Web App Frameworks
- Vue.js (independently managed)

- Ember.js (a bit older)
- Polymer. js (by Google, uses HTML5 Web Components rather than "virtual components")
